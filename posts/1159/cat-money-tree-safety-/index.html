If options for safe access are not available, it may be best to keep the money tree out of the cat’s reach.” (Karen Geddis, veterinary behaviorist).\nStudies have shown that over 28 percent of cat owners have reported that their cats are attracted to items that resemble plants, such as money trees.\nA money tree is popular for its decorative purpose, however, cats may be inclined to chew on its leaves and bark. Money tree leaves tend to contain toxic compounds, such as saponins and polyphones, that can be harmful to cats.\nI. Are Money Trees Toxic to Cats? Although money trees can bring a lot of beauty and prosperity into your home, it is important to consider the safety of your cats if you have them. Money trees contain chemicals, such as oxalates, that can be toxic to cats if ingested. Symptoms of oxalate toxicity include drooling, vomiting, and difficulty breathing. You should also consider the size of your money tree and the environment in which it is kept. If your money tree is too large, it could be a potential hazard for your cat to climb or could contain tendrils and leaves that your cat could chew and swallow. Lastly, if you plan to keep your money tree in a place accessible to your cat, you should regularly inspect it to make sure there are no signs of deterioration or decay that could harm your cat.

The Hazards of Money Trees for Cats Money trees, also known as pachira aquatica, are popular additions to homes and workplaces alike due to its low maintenance and attractive looks.

How to Keep Your Cat Safe Around Money Trees Money trees are an attractive addition to indoors, but if you have cats, you may be wondering if they are safe. While money trees aren’t toxic to cats, there are some safety considerations to keep in mind. All cats are individuals and can react differently to a new plant, so it’s important to watch your kitty’s behavior when introducing a new species. Additionally, money trees have furry leaves, and cats can be tempted to chew on them, leading to possible ingestion of fur or leaves. Therefore, it’s best to keep money trees out of reach of cats to avoid any potential problems.\nII. What Are the Pros and Cons of Keeping a Money Tree in Your Home? Having a money tree in your home can be an interesting and mesmerizing experience, but it’s important to consider the safety of your pets before bringing one home.

Additionally, some of the soil used to grow them may contain pesticides or other chemicals that can be harmful if your cat were to come into contact with it.

Studies have shown that plants can help reduce stress and anxiety in animals, so if you do decide to bring home a money tree, make sure it’s placed in an area where your cat can sit and observe it.\nLastly, it’s important to be mindful of the leaves on your money tree. Cats tend to chew them for the moisture and minerals they provide, but the leaves are high in phosphorus and calcium which could lead to an overload if your cat ingests too many of them.

If you notice any, promptly remove them to make sure they do not pose a hazard to your cat.\nYou should also make sure to water your money tree regularly, as this will help to keep the environment moist enough to be healthy for your pet.
