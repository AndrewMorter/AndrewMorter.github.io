A: Big Meech&rsquo;s legacy is one of crime and violence. He is remembered as one of the most influential figures in the American drug trade and a powerful force behind much of the crack cocaine epidemic that swept the country in the 1980s and 1990s. Despite his criminal activities, Big Meech is also remembered for his philanthropy and support for the Detroit community.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://Andrewmorter.github.io/posts/1727/how-cardi-b-achieved-a-net-worth-of-24-million-in-2021/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>How Cardi B Achieved a Net Worth of $24 Million in 2021</span></a>
